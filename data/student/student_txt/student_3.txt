"Thanks to ACI, I was able to achieve a perfect score of 2400 on the SAT on my first try. I would especially like to thank my teachers for their motivating and inspiring way of teaching. Their fun and witty style of teaching made mastering that part of the SAT a lot more bearable, as it can be tedious. Their techniques helped me strengthen my skills, and have found myself able to apply them even outside of testing."
